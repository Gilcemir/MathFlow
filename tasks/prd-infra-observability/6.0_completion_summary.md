- `docker/local/docker-compose.metrics.yml` - Fixed all infrastructure service paths

**Changes Made:**
- Updated build context from `.` to `../../`
- Updated volume mounts from `./docker/infra/` to `../../docker/infra/`
- All paths now correctly reference project root

### 4. End-to-End Tests ✅

**Test Execution Summary:**

#### Infrastructure Tests
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: Started successfully on port 5432
- ✅ **OTEL Collector**: Running on ports 4317, 4318, 8888, 8889
- ✅ **Loki**: Running on port 3100 (initializing)
- ✅ **Prometheus**: Ready on port 9090
- ✅ **Grafana**: Accessible on port 3000

#### Application Tests
- ✅ **Application**: Running and responding on port 5124
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Endpoints accessible
- ✅ **Metrics Endpoint**: Available at /metrics
- ✅ **OpenTelemetry**: Configured and logging telemetry data

#### Integration Tests
- ✅ **Prometheus Targets**: All 3 targets healthy (up)
- ✅ **Network**: All containers on `mathflow` network
- ✅ **Logs**: Application logs visible with OpenTelemetry data
- ✅ **Container Health**: All containers running without errors

**Test Commands Executed:**
```bash
# Start infrastructure
make docker-infra-up

# Start metrics stack
docker compose -f docker/local/docker-compose.metrics.yml up -d

# Start application
docker compose -f docker/local/docker-compose.yml up --build -d

# Validate services
curl http://localhost:5124          # ✅ Application responding
curl http://localhost:3000          # ✅ Grafana accessible
curl http://localhost:9090/-/ready  # ✅ Prometheus ready
curl http://localhost:3100/ready    # ✅ Loki running
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets  # ✅ All targets healthy

# Stop everything
docker compose down (all files)
```

## Technical Details

### Makefile Implementation

**Design Decisions:**
- Used `.PHONY` targets to prevent conflicts with files
- Organized commands into logical sections (Build, Docker Infra, Docker App)
- Added informative echo messages with emojis for better UX
- Included service URLs in output for convenience
- Created useful aliases for common commands

**Path Handling:**
- All docker-compose commands use explicit `-f` flag with full path
- Build commands use `cd` to navigate to correct directory
- Clean command uses `find` to recursively remove build artifacts

### Docker Compose Path Resolution

**Root Cause:**
When docker-compose files were moved from project root to `docker/local/`, the relative paths were not updated. This caused:
- Build context errors (could not find source files)
- Volume mount failures (could not find config files)
- Service startup failures

**Solution:**
Updated all relative paths to use `../../` to reference project root:
- Build contexts: `context: ../../`
- Volume mounts: `../../docker/infra/...`

### E2E Test Results

**All Critical Paths Validated:**
1. ✅ Infrastructure startup (PostgreSQL, network creation)
2. ✅ Observability stack (OTEL, Loki, Prometheus, Grafana)
3. ✅ Application build and deployment
4. ✅ Service communication (app → OTEL → Prometheus/Loki)
5. ✅ Health checks and metrics endpoints
6. ✅ Telemetry data flow (logs visible in console)

**Performance Metrics:**
- Infrastructure startup: ~5 seconds
- Metrics stack startup: ~10 seconds
- Application build + startup: ~15 seconds
- Total stack ready: ~30 seconds
- All containers healthy and stable

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Docker Compose Path Errors
**Problem:** Build context and volume paths incorrect after moving compose files  
**Solution:** Updated all paths to use `../../` relative to `docker/local/`  
**Impact:** Resolved - all services now start correctly

### Issue 2: External Network Not Found
**Problem:** Application compose file expected external `mathflow` network  
**Solution:** Start infrastructure first to create network, then start app  
**Impact:** Documented in README and Makefile commands handle this correctly

### Issue 3: Obsolete Version Attribute Warning
**Problem:** Docker Compose shows warning about `version` attribute  
**Impact:** Minor - does not affect functionality, can be removed in future cleanup

3. Add `make logs-app` and `make logs-infra` for filtered logs
4. Create `make clean-docker` to remove volumes and images
5. Add health check polling in Makefile before declaring services ready

### Production Readiness
The following items should be addressed before production deployment:
1. Create production docker-compose files in `docker/production/`
2. Set up external database (not containerized PostgreSQL)
3. Configure external observability services (managed Prometheus/Grafana)
4. Implement secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
5. Add resource limits and scaling configurations
6. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
